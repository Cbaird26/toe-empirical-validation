# Simple Push Instructions - New Repository Name

## 🎯 Easy Solution: Just Use a Different Name!

Since `mqgt-scf` already exists, let's use a different name. Here are some suggestions:

### Suggested Names:
1. **mqgt-scf-validation** - Clear and descriptive
2. **toe-empirical-validation** - Theory of Everything focus
3. **mqgt-scf-empirical** - Shorter version
4. **theory-of-everything-validation** - Full descriptive name
5. **mqgt-validation-2026** - With year
6. **toe-proof** - Short and catchy

### Quick Steps:

**1. Create new repository on GitHub:**
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Name: Choose any of the above (or your own)
- Description: "Empirical Validation of MQGT-SCF Theory of Everything"
- Public
- **Don't** initialize with README
- Click "Create repository"

**2. Push your code:**

```bash
cd "/Users/christophermichaelbaird/Downloads/mqgt_scf_reissue_2026-01-20_010939UTC"

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

**3. Or use the script:**

```bash
./PUSH_NEW_REPO_NAME.sh
```

The script will guide you through everything!
